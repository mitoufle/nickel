To edit CSS file, you need to work on _variables.scss which is a generic
file for style management.

.scss files are not readable as style file by any browser. in order to change
it to .css files, you need to use SASS which is a RUBY gem(bundle).

Install ruby, then install sass using uby cmd with 'gem install sass', still
in ruby cmd use this command to update css file:

'sass --watch sourcefolder/sass:destinationfolder/css'

in this case, when prompt placed in nickel/style/ use:

'sass --watch scss/materialize.scss:compiled/test.css'

your css file will be auto updated once one off the scss file is edited.
